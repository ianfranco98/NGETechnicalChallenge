# NGETechnicalChallenge

This game was a technical test proposed by Nimble Giant Entertainment in 2020 in order to apply for game programmer role.

It's a multiplayer shooter where you need to shoot the colored cubes. When a cube is hit is destroyed and all cubes of the same color next to this one will also be destroyed. The more cubes you destroy with one bullet, the more score you'll earn.

This was also one of my firsts contact with Unreal Engine. With this exercise I learned about the engine environment, its C++ Framework and also a lot of technical knowledge about networking applied to online games.
